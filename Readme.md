# How to show cells' values over an image and be able to export the cells' content to Excel file


<p>This example demonstrates how to show images in GridView's cell and display cell's values over the images. Actually, this task can be easily accomplished using the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraGridViewsGridGridView_CustomDrawCelltopic">Custom Draw capabilites</a>. However, in this case, these values cannot be exported.  If this functionality is required,  you should create necessary images and populate unbound columns via the CustomUnboundColumnData event.</p>
